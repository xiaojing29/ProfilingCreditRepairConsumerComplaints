This was a shock considering I am a single working mother with one job of over 28 years, and no debt at all except for a mortgage. I only have one credit card that I use, and I have no outstanding debt at all except my mortgage. I pay all my credit card statements in full each month, so there is no debt in my name. I asked for a full credit report from XXXX XXXX to find out why I was rejected. I was shocked to find that the report showed a name on my credit report that was not my name ( they have since taken off ). In addition, the report showed a phone number that I don't recognize. I have some credit cards that were issued in my name from XXXX including a debt collection agency ( Jefferson Capital Systems ) that has tried to get {$4200.00} from an unpaid XXXX XXXX account XXXX even though I have never had the credit cards named, nor have I I never had a XXXX XXXX account XXXX I issued an immediate investigation by XXXX XXXX and in XXXX I was told that the report was accurate. I have tried contacting Jefferson Capital Systems and have been unable to even get into their system. I also contacted my family financial advisor and she was unable to give me any names of people or companies that may help.

This is a lie because all of my information was verified when I opened the account and nothing changed. The email said that they would pay out all the money I was owed within 14 days. Its now been a month and a half and I still havent received the money. Ive called and emailed them several times and have been unable to get any results about what information couldnt be verified or when I will receive my money.

There were no messages in the app saying the account was closed, it still showed open. I had no idea as I didnt even get a letter or fair warning they were writing it off. They then put on my credit files that the loan was paid in full but listed as a written off account. They have done the exact opposite of what the loan was meant for.

      "Incorrect Predictions:\n",
      "Text: We entered into an agreement with Lexington Law to address our credit concerns on XX/XX/23, initially paying a fee of {$69.00}. However, we've experienced continuous charges totaling over {$400.00} on XX/XX/23, XX/XX/23, and XX/XX/23, without observing any improvements on both our accounts. This raises concerns about their compliance with the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA) as they have charged upfront fees without delivering the promised results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, we were verbally informed about a family plan, entailing a combined monthly charge of {$130.00} for both of us. Despite this representation, separate charges have been applied, contradicting the family plan agreement due to our shared residence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite expecting a refund within 3-5 business days from XX/XX/23, Lexington Law has delayed the process, insisting on an investigation into a recorded phone call. Regrettably, our request for the recorded call has been met with reluctance. While asserting our legal rights to a full refund, Lexington Law proceeded to refund only half of the amount, adding further frustration to the situation. This raises concerns about transparency and adherence to consumer protection laws., Predicted: 2, Actual: 3\n",
      "Text: XXXX whole year Ive been going thur identity theft all XXXX credit bureaus have my documents and police report on file. I pay monthly for Experian app to keep my information safe and secure. I also have locks and freeze on my account including a pin which I change that and my email frequently due to ID theft. Somehow Experian is still allowing this thief to hack my account that I pay monthly to protect and alert me when someone apply or change anything on my account. Which is all fraud this person changes my personal information adding contact numbers Ive never had changing my email address so when they apply for new credit the company would call the fraudulent numbers. Experian is allowing this thief to add fraudulent addresses to my account that is vacant houses.Address that are not on file for me to receive mail from United States post office. I also have a statement up stating the only XXXX addresses and only XXXX should be on file for me. Experian still allows the fraudulent person to update new things to my personal information on my credit report its unbelievable. I also believe someone here that works at this company is also using my information, due to the fact I have a pin set only myself and Experian knows it, so how is this other person/persons still getting in my account? They are very unprofessional now my information has been uploaded to dark web ect this has really ruined my life, Predicted: 0, Actual: 2\n",
      "Text: Lexington law firm XX/XX/2023 Paid for service not received they never helped me with removing negative items from my credit as they stated they would The stated Due to COVID-19 loss of income and The identity fraud that happened during Covid-19 They would help me in removing all these false inquiries but they did nothing they charged me to see my credit even though they already had my credit profile, Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: So I am looking on my XXXX XXXX and XXXX credit report on XX/XX/XXXX and I see I have 2 student loans from Nelnet that were taken out under my name on XX/XX/XXXX one amount for XXXX $ and another amount for XXXX $ both on the same day. I have never in my life taken out any kind of student loans this is 100 % and I have no idea what to do from this point., Predicted: 1, Actual: 0\n",

I have 2 hard inquireys on each file and they want take them off my report. I made police report and did this ftc report but they still are breaking American federal and state laws. \n",

He stated to me he could get my credit debt disputed but i have to pay {$190.00} for initial fee, then {$99.00} a month until it is resolved then I call them ( credit sage ) to cancel the {$99.00} a month. I did however give him my husbands FULL Social Security and Date Of Birth. I do not want any of that information to get leaked or someone opens a credit card, or something serious with my husbands information. Please help., Predicted: 1, Actual: 0\n",
      "Text: In regards to CFPB v. Freedom Debt Relief , LLC Case No. Case No. 3:17-cv-06484-EDL I was a Freedom Debt Relief { FDR } client since XX/XX/XXXX and paid a total of {$19000.00} into their debt relief program. ( i can provide documentation. ) I am outraged having learned after all this time how wrongfully I have been not only deceived but actually robbed by this company. I literally struggled and sacrificed my blood, sweat and tears for over 2 years to come up with the {$280.00} payment to this company every 2 weeks. I'm not a wealthy man so that is a lot of money for me and difficult to accomplish. But as you can see from the evidence, i did. And when I tell you that's the XXXXXXXX XXXX honest truth, it's the XXXXXXXX XXXX honest truth. \n",
      "With that being said, I'm sure you can imagine the hardship it caused me. This revelation makes me sick to my stomach realizing the extent of work and diligence I provided only to find out it was based a huge scam I was a victim of the whole time. Even though I'm directly affected by this case and completely entitled to the proceeds, I was not told about this suit at all and had no idea of its existence until the date of this writing, XX/XX/XXXX. And not to be blunt, but I don't want to hear the payments stopped in XX/XX/XXXX, because that would be extremely unfair and detrimental towards me especially since the entire case hadn't been disclosed to me whatsoever and I have irrefutable evidence of how I'm the definition of the affected consumer in this situation. Had I not curiously been browsing the Consumer Financial Protection website ; I still wouldn't have known. I was never even informed considering how directly I was a victim of it. All I wanted to do is pay off my debt as honest hard-working guy. \n",
      "Even more so, I just obtained an XXXX  credit report dating XX/XX/XXXX ( i can provide documentation ) and I've found that FDR had outright lied about accounts being paid off.

I was actually quite offended when I first brought this up and they told me they would be kind enough to refund me one of those charges but not the rest.

That's a complete scam they have that there on purpose because they know for a fact that's not how normal loans work nor is it how any service is provided because once the service is done the payments are done not in this case. In this case once your business is done with them they continue to take until you say no more and then when you do they pretend like they're doing you a favor by giving you your last payment back rather than all of your money that you are due that they stole from you.

Gitmeid law did nothing to help me. Except kept the {$8400.00} that i paid them as thier fee., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: I went ahead and checked my credit report. On the Experian website I noticed some discrepancies on my report and continued to dispute the debt accounts I had on my credit report. Now because I had done it before I was very familiar with the process, from the time I have submitted, creditors that reported to experian have 30 days to come up with actual proof of my debt in XXXX and white. \n",

      "Not even XXXX weeks had passed I went and checked the status of my credit and low and behold all the. Disputes had been rejected. Now how is that possible XXXX they have to come up with the actual proof of debt, I believe I have to be CC? \n",
      "\n",
      "Now every single dispute was rejected and if those creditors came up with hard evidence of my debt, can I take a look, its my credit. Im not just gon na take someones word for it. Also I would like to probably get a second and third opinion, like the other XXXX credit bureaus. \n",
      "\n",
      "So very serious issue here with my credit, its my financial life which in turn is my life. Last time I disputed I had won all my disputes and raised my credit score significantly. \n",

They got me through mail offers, promising to handle my credit debt without pushing me into bankruptcy. Sounded good, but it's been a nightmare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the deal: they claim they'll negotiate my debt, but all they do is let my credit cards hit delinquency, tanking my credit score. Then, when my creditors finally offer me a deal to settle the debt, these guys charge me 25% of my original debt. For what? Sitting back and watching my credit score dive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gets worse. After a year of payments, which I thought were fixing my debt, they dangle this fake loan in front of me. This \"loan\" is supposed to cover the rest of my debt, but guess what? It's a trap. The loan is from their sister company, and applying for it just hits my credit score even harder. And the loan amount? It's way less than what they promised, leaving me with a high-interest loan and a pile of debt that they never even touched.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real kicker? I can see the money being pulled from my account (ACH withdrawals), but I can't touch it. It's sitting in their account, and I'm left high and dry. If I try to get out of this mess or ask for a refund, I hit a wall. They've done nothing they promised, and I'm stuck with ruined credit and a financial mess., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",

I began making payments and in XXXX of XXXX opened a credit card account with said services. I continued to make all payments on time. This went on until XXXX of XXXX when I received an email stating that my accounts would be closed. The reason they said was that my information couldnt be verified. This is a lie because all of my information was verified when I opened the account and nothing changed. The email said that they would pay out all the money I was owed within 14 days. Its now been a month and a half and I still havent received the money. Ive called and emailed them several times and have been unable to get any results about what information couldnt be verified or when I will receive my money. Ive since found out through XXXX that this company is known for doing this. I believe this is a scam in which they take peoples money and put it in high yield interest accounts in order to profit before returning the money to the people its owed., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: Credit Glory charges a non refundable set up fee of {$170.00}, in addition to a required subscription for {$99.00} per month.

      "1 month into services, I received letters from XXXX and XXXX that a 3rd party attempted to start a dispute on my behalf but failed to identify themselves as my authorized representative. Therefore, no action had been taken on my account. So by this time, I was already being billed for a second month of subscription services. Fortunately, I was able to push my billing date back with Credit Glory enough to be able to see their results, which was no further along since the bureaus blocked action on my account. Therefore, I was only charged the 1 month of subscription for {$99.00} for Credit Glory. I was still charged 2 months for XXXX XXXX  As I understand, they are a separate company. However, Credit Glory is the original entity that signed me up and and took payment for both Credit Glory and XXXX XXXX  services., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: In XX/XX/2022 I was surprised to find out that I was rejected from being able to accept the student loans that I had qualified for in order to send my daughter to college. This was a shock considering I am a single working mother with one job of over 28 years, and no debt at all except for a mortgage. I only have one credit card that I use, and I have no outstanding debt at all except my mortgage. I pay all my credit card statements in full each month, so there is no debt in my name. I asked for a full credit report from XXXX XXXX to find out why I was rejected. I was shocked to find that the report showed a name on my credit report that was not my name ( they have since taken off ). In addition, the report showed a phone number that I don't recognize. I have some credit cards that were issued in my name from XXXX including a debt collection agency ( Jefferson Capital Systems ) that has tried to get {$4200.00} from an unpaid XXXX XXXX account XXXX even though I have never had the credit cards named, nor have I I never had a XXXX XXXX account XXXX I issued an immediate investigation by XXXX XXXX and in XXXX I was told that the report was accurate. I have tried contacting Jefferson Capital Systems and have been unable to even get into their system. I also contacted my family financial advisor and she was unable to give me any names of people or companies that may help. I hope you can help to investigate further how these accounts were issued in my name and remove them from my credit history! Thank you., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: This business, who advertises their false services through social media such as XXXX, is nothing more than a scam, deliberately keeping peoples money who need help and not providing the service they promise upon receipt of payment. \n",
      "When you first call for a consultation, they are very quick to ask for their upfront fee of {$270.00}, and then they ask you to schedule a call to go over your credit issues, but you cant schedule a call until 2-3 months later. \n",
      "I did just that, expect that when they decided to call me back over 2 months later, I had already solved my credit issue on my own. \n",
      "I filed a lawsuit against the credit bureaus in which I prevailed and got the fraudulent items removed from my reports. \n",
      "This company did absolutely nothing more than lie and steal my money, as they have done with every other innocent potential client they have ever tried to have. Their reviews under the XXXX speak for themselves. They scam people and get away with it. \n",
      "I filed a charge back with my credit card company and this ridiculous company argued that they provided a service which they most definitely did not. Therefore my credit card company inadvertently sided with them, not knowing what the scam they are dealing with. \n",

I was actually quite offended when I first brought this up and they told me they would be kind enough to refund me one of those charges but not the rest. The way I read that is it's our money to do whatever we wish and here 's XXXX bucks for your problems. It doesn't work that way. There are laws against that specifically when I came to make this complaint it was literally an option to click services paid for but not received. They had me paying {$20.00} a month I'm supposedly what they say is my fault because after everything is paid off I'm supposed to then call them back and let them know I don't want them to take the money from me anymore they're not providing me with anything but I need to call them and tell them to stop taking money from me. That's a complete scam they have that there on purpose because they know for a fact that's not how normal loans work nor is it how any service is provided because once the service is done the payments are done not in this case. In this case once your business is done with them they continue to take until you say no more and then when you do they pretend like they're doing you a favor by giving you your last payment back rather than all of your money that you are due that they stole from you. Either way I told them already to stop doing it which also shown in my records which I will provide the {$19.00} that they gave back to me out of the kindness of their heart but that doesn't account for the at least eight from what I'm able to pull up it could be more but as of what I have right now there are eight payments of {$20.00} that they think is their money for providing me no service for trying to take it on a technicality that I never saw that's for sure beforehand otherwise who would in their right mind tell them to stop taking money why would I want you to take money from me if you're not providing me anything but yet that's the way your system works and that can only be for one reason because no one again in their right mind would pay a company just to pay a company. \n",

      "XX/XX/2022 I made my last payment on the loan which was a lump sum of {$450.00}.

I actually had to call initially to get them to send me the lump sum that was in the account even though it was supposed to automatically go to me It didn't so I had to call to make that happen as well That's why that didn't happen until XXXX. So in between the months of XXXX through XXXX they had me paying for services not rendered. I was actually challenged to leave this complaint as if it was going to do me no good or they were trying to call my bluff either or I don't care what they're doing is theft and against the law which I explain to them in full but I guess they know best right? I mean it is their money we're talking about And I should have been fully aware that they're above the law but I will say that I had no idea so I apologize for making this complaint I just had to make sure even though I do know you're above the law because that was fully explain to me when I explained that it was illegal. What I'm wanting to know is this something I'm going to be able to sue them for because to me that's eight separate violations if I'm not mistaken each a sueable offense with the maximum of {$1000.00} per charge. I fully explain this as well and I explained it I would attempt to charge back the money on my card anyways with the bank which they in turn would just have to then pay the investigation fee and ultimately lose because I'm paying for services not rendered in my bank will not stand for that because no one in their right mind would except for money lion which is how I know that they're running a scam because they would lose any sort of investigation yet they have this written down and they're doing this to multiple people everyday. The way they have their system set up is embarrassing for them to be so petty to take from people that are trying to do good and fix their credit and they should be sending themselves even though I know no such thing exists but it should and they should be embarrassed poor damaging families trying to better themselves. No one else would get away with that not without getting canceled. And then the way they have it set up is if anybody calls and compliance offer them one payment back and that's it and standard procedure I know because I have called and talked to four different agents and got the same exact answer the last two times were literary to just test the water and see if that's what the case was and it absolutely was. They're doing this to people everyday and it needs to stop there's no telling you how much money they have right now that actually should not be their money and they have received fraudulently for services not rendered., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",

      "Text: I applied for a loan mean to build my credit through MoneyLion. The loan they offer is called the MoneyLion Credit Builder Plus Loan. The entire purpose of the loan is to boosts a consumers credit score. I didnt event get the entire loan up front as part of the terms of the loan is that a portion of it will be held in a reserve and will not be spendable until the loan is paid off in full. During the entire term on this loan I did not see an increase in my credit score like they said it would do. towards the last few months of the loan term I had gotten a new debit card and had forgotten to update it for the MoneyLion loan. Once I realized this I immediately paid off the entire renaming balance with a part of my reserve they were withholding. This was 2-3 months after changing my debit card. I was never told the account was being wrote off, they state they wrote it off in XXXX but I paid the entire balance on this loan in XXXX. There were no messages in the app saying the account was closed, it still showed open. I had no idea as I didnt even get a letter or fair warning they were writing it off. They then put on my credit files that the loan was paid in full but listed as a written off account. They have done the exact opposite of what the loan was meant for. This loan was suppose to help me build my score as they advertised and promised and instead has caused a damaging impact to my credit score, and has made it extremely difficult for me to get accepted for any other financial products. Ive tried disputing this multiple times and they tell me they refuse to remove it from my file. This is the biggest scam and a complete lie of a loan program., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",

Obviously I don't have it, why are you charging all my cards -_- then because you did not get the XXXX dollars you closed my account and BTW I don't owe them XXXX $ they never gave me money. The deal was pay XXXX $ to build credit .... They using false debts as ways to target my credit... Mind you my credit score was only going up XXXX to XXXX pts at a time -_- definitely violates fair credit reporting act. And they try to control the narrative because when they opened their dispute system is not like you can write what happened and their asking for personal documents you dont need to dispute a false report... I can just go to cfpb why would I send them my personal iD and I already know u trying to collect money? It's not like this business gave me anything... They gave me XXXX $ on the account which was for books ONLY and was paid off didn't even use the rest of the money... Then they ask me for XXXX $ for building credit ... Then they started getting greedy and taking avantage relying on the money. Then in return talking about they chaning atm fees like nah thats not the deal or what I signed off on.

I couldn't afford to make payments on my credit cards, and it took about 10 weeks to receive my first stimulus check, which I hoped would help me catch up on missed payments. During this time, I enrolled in a debt management program with a company that consolidated some of my credit card balances into a single payment. I successfully paid off this consolidated debt within 2 years. \n",

      "Later on, I received a telemarketing call from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( now Redwood Processing ), which offered an alternative debt resolution method. They claimed that when creditors sell debt to collections agencies, proper processes and protocols are not always followed, creating a gray area where debt can be dismissed or discharged. They suggested that to invalidate the debt, I should stop making payments, as making payments would acknowledge the validity of the debt. In a moment of desperation, I signed an agreement with them, hoping for a fresh start. They informed me that the debt resolution program would take approximately 21 months and would cost {$8100.00}, payable in monthly installments of {$380.00}. \n",

      "However, my debt was never resolved, and it has now been 45 months since I enrolled in the program. To make matters worse, one of the original creditors has filed a lawsuit against me.

If I hadn't been paying XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$380.00} per month, I could have used that money to make arrangements directly with my creditors and pay off the debt. \n",
