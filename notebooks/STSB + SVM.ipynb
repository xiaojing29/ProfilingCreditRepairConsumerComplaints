      "Text: In XX/XX/2022 I was surprised to find out that I was rejected from being able to accept the student loans that I had qualified for in order to send my daughter to college. This was a shock considering I am a single working mother with one job of over 28 years, and no debt at all except for a mortgage. I only have one credit card that I use, and I have no outstanding debt at all except my mortgage. I pay all my credit card statements in full each month, so there is no debt in my name. I asked for a full credit report from XXXX XXXX to find out why I was rejected. I was shocked to find that the report showed a name on my credit report that was not my name ( they have since taken off ). In addition, the report showed a phone number that I don't recognize.

( i can provide documentation. ) I am outraged having learned after all this time how wrongfully I have been not only deceived but actually robbed by this company. I literally struggled and sacrificed my blood, sweat and tears for over 2 years to come up with the {$280.00} payment to this company every 2 weeks. I'm not a wealthy man so that is a lot of money for me and difficult to accomplish. But as you can see from the evidence, i did. And when I tell you that's the XXXXXXXX XXXX honest truth, it's the XXXXXXXX XXXX honest truth. \n",

And not to be blunt, but I don't want to hear the payments stopped in XX/XX/XXXX, because that would be extremely unfair and detrimental towards me especially since the entire case hadn't been disclosed to me whatsoever and I have irrefutable evidence of how I'm the definition of the affected consumer in this situation. Had I not curiously been browsing the Consumer Financial Protection website ; I still wouldn't have known. I was never even informed considering how directly I was a victim of it. All I wanted to do is pay off my debt as honest hard-working guy. \n",

As you can see on the display that FDR provides to myself through their website, it shows the debt payments completely paid but then when you look at the XXXX report, they're still listed as bad debt and not paid/settled as FDR led me to believe. That is the definition a fraud/deceptive practices. \n",

Does this mean they straight up pocketed {$19000.00} of my hard-earned money?? \n",

      "Text: In the middle of the investigation by the consumer protection bureau referencing this number XXXX simultaneously at Navy Federal credit Union For accounts that have been paid as agreed disappeared from the report I might investigation prove that they disappear from the system at XXXX XXXX , I brought XXXX XXXX attention . To the missing accounts. To my surprise they where no answer. Of so I should then a picture of what the reported to the bureaus In the past 22 accounts minus chicken in savings Now they are only reporting 18. So I called before the XX/XX/2022 and the total accounts was 18. When I called on the XXXX/XXXX/2022 it was 19 accounts. So its obvious That someone is trying to fix the situation by putting the accounts back. But if XXXX XXXX  has been hacked. They need to say that. And get better cyber security. Now in between XXXX XXXX And XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent two false derogatory remarks on my couldnt report. ( I have zero negative accounts in the federal ) when I say all my accounts are +100 % of my accounts are positive. I called XXXX XXXX  to ask XXXX XXXX to ask about the negative remarks they sent to the credit bureaus. This is the second Falls information you have reported against me in less than 30 days. The say to ask XXXX. So now I know all of my bank information is compromised from within the bank And they are not willing to do an investigation inside of their back office. So I know theyve done this to other people before Can CFPB love look into this 1 information and accounts missing at the time of a CFPB investigation. 2 how is it possible for Fake derogatory remarks to be sent to the bureaus and the consumer not to have a right to ask what are the remarks from the source.

      "They gave misleading information and had my score raise and closed my account and then act like they are not returning my money.

There was nowhere that informed me that one would be run either. I was not seeking credit of any kind, but rather simply adding my own personal bank account for ACH transfers. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) strictly prohibits pulling a consumer 's credit for an impermissible purpose as Global Payments Inc has done here. Furthermore, Global Payments Inc informed me that my request to add my bank was denied based on said credit check. As I have a credit score of XXXX with all 3 credit agencies, I was very curious as to the reasons I would be denied based on a credit check. I inquired as to why I was denied and was told they would not give me that information. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) mandates that lenders that deny credit to their applicants must state their reason for the rejection. Again, Global Payments Inc, outright refused to provide the reason for denial.
