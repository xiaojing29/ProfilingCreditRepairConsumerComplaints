      "Text: I unfortunately decided to use money lion and their credit repair service which came at a fee of {$19.00} every month on top of the bill I was already paying so it's quite an outrageous fee to begin with to consider the little to none that it does work their credit but in my case I didn't like those fees and was not aware it was going to cost me that much per month to have a two-point raise in my credit that's why I decided to pay the whole loan off It was in just a couple of months rather than taking the whole year that way I could save that money that otherwise would have just been taken from me and to my surprise I look almost a year later and they're still withdrawing the {$19.00} even though The service they provided me and the loan they provided me was paid in full which is shown in documented in my bank statement by the amount they sent me once it was paid off because once the loan is paid off it acts as a piggy bank and you get that money sent back to you. I was actually quite offended when I first brought this up and they told me they would be kind enough to refund me one of those charges but not the rest. The way I read that is it's our money to do whatever we wish and here 's XXXX bucks for your problems. It doesn't work that way. There are laws against that specifically when I came to make this complaint it was literally an option to click services paid for but not received. They had me paying {$20.00} a month I'm supposedly what they say is my fault because after everything is paid off I'm supposed to then call them back and let them know I don't want them to take the money from me anymore they're not providing me with anything but I need to call them and tell them to stop taking money from me. That's a complete scam they have that there on purpose because they know for a fact that's not how normal loans work nor is it how any service is provided because once the service is done the payments are done not in this case. In this case once your business is done with them they continue to take until you say no more and then when you do they pretend like they're doing you a favor by giving you your last payment back rather than all of your money that you are due that they stole from you. Either way I told them already to stop doing it which also shown in my records which I will provide the {$19.00} that they gave back to me out of the kindness of their heart but that doesn't account for the at least eight from what I'm able to pull up it could be more but as of what I have right now there are eight payments of {$20.00} that they think is their money for providing me no service for trying to take it on a technicality that I never saw that's for sure beforehand otherwise who would in their right mind tell them to stop taking money why would I want you to take money from me if you're not providing me anything but yet that's the way your system works and that can only be for one reason because no one again in their right mind would pay a company just to pay a company. \n",

I actually had to call initially to get them to send me the lump sum that was in the account even though it was supposed to automatically go to me It didn't so I had to call to make that happen as well That's why that didn't happen until XXXX.

The way they have their system set up is embarrassing for them to be so petty to take from people that are trying to do good and fix their credit and they should be sending themselves even though I know no such thing exists but it should and they should be embarrassed poor damaging families trying to better themselves. No one else would get away with that not without getting canceled. And then the way they have it set up is if anybody calls and compliance offer them one payment back and that's it and standard procedure I know because I have called and talked to four different agents and got the same exact answer the last two times were literary to just test the water and see if that's what the case was and it absolutely was.

But wait, there's more! After I committed, they told me I needed an additional subscription to [Third-Party Service] for a separate fee. Talk about hidden costs!\n",

So, guess what? Absolutely nothing was done on my account. Meanwhile, I'm being billed for a second month of this circus.\n",

The credit bureaus had blocked any action because of Credit Glory's blunder. So, I ended up paying only one month of Credit Glory's fee, but I still got charged for two months by [Third-Party Service]. And let's not forget, Credit Glory was the one who signed me up for both services.\n",

However, it became apparent that XXXXX was not genuinely interested in assisting me with credit repair. Instead, they resorted to charging multiple credit cards excessively without my consent. This was followed by an unreasonable demand for XXXX $ to initiate a dispute, a sum I clearly did not possess, leading to the unwarranted closure of my account.\n",

      "Furthermore, the company's claim of removing false debts and improving my credit score was misleading. The incremental increase in my score by only X to X points was negligible and did not justify their exorbitant fees. Their approach to disputes was also questionable, requiring personal documents that are unnecessary for disputing false reports. This raises serious concerns about their intentions and respect for client privacy.\n",

In this case once your business is done with them they continue to take until you say no more and then when you do they pretend like they're doing you a favor by giving you your last payment back rather than all of your money that you are due that they stole from you.

      "Text: I opened an account with the XXXX  XXXX, who uses Global Payments Inc to process deposits. I added my bank account and was denied the ability to make ACH deposits into my account. Upon contacting Global Payments Inc, I was informed that they, illegally, ran a credit check without my permission. Again, there was no request anywhere for my permission to run a credit check. There was nowhere that informed me that one would be run either. I was not seeking credit of any kind, but rather simply adding my own personal bank account for ACH transfers. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) strictly prohibits pulling a consumer 's credit for an impermissible purpose as Global Payments Inc has done here. Furthermore, Global Payments Inc informed me that my request to add my bank was denied based on said credit check. As I have a credit score of XXXX with all 3 credit agencies, I was very curious as to the reasons I would be denied based on a credit check. I inquired as to why I was denied and was told they would not give me that information. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) mandates that lenders that deny credit to their applicants must state their reason for the rejection. Again, Global Payments Inc, outright refused to provide the reason for denial. I then asked for their legal mailing address for the purpose of filing a complaint with the CFPB and was initially denied that information as well. This company is violating the law, repeatedly, and then trying to conceal their identity from the government agency that regulates their industry. This needs to stop and the company needs to be fined and held accountable., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: I am writing this complaint regarding the services provided by the Lexington Law Firm for repairing my credit report. I started making payments at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I paid XXXX every month and promised me that my credit would be fix in less than 6 months.Unfortunately, I am extremely dissatisfied with the outcome of their services, as they have failed to make any significant improvement to my credit report. \n",
      "\n",
      "I initially contacted Lexington Law Firm several months ago with the hope of repairing my credit report, as it contained several errors and negative marks that were impacting my financial wellbeing. I provided them with all the necessary information and documentation they requested, and they assured me that they would be able to help me improve my credit score. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, after paying a substantial amount of money for their services and waiting for months, I found out that they had done very little to repair my credit report. In fact, my credit score had barely improved, and many of the negative marks that were supposed to be removed were still present on my credit report. \n",
      "Despite numerous attempts to contact the firm to address these issues, I have not received any satisfactory response from them. This lack of accountability and transparency is unacceptable and has left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. After they terminated my because I was complaining they charged me {$8.00} a month unlawfully. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I request that the Lexington Law Firm take immediate action to rectify the situation by either refunding my money from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I hope that this matter can be resolved as soon as possible and that such a situation will not arise for any other customer in the future. \n",

      "Text: In regards to CFPB v. Freedom Debt Relief , LLC Case No. Case No. 3:17-cv-06484-EDL I was a Freedom Debt Relief { FDR } client since XX/XX/XXXX and paid a total of {$19000.00} into their debt relief program. ( i can provide documentation. ) I am outraged having learned after all this time how wrongfully I have been not only deceived but actually robbed by this company. I literally struggled and sacrificed my blood, sweat and tears for over 2 years to come up with the {$280.00} payment to this company every 2 weeks. I'm not a wealthy man so that is a lot of money for me and difficult to accomplish. But as you can see from the evidence, i did. And when I tell you that's the XXXXXXXX XXXX honest truth, it's the XXXXXXXX XXXX honest truth. \n",
      "With that being said, I'm sure you can imagine the hardship it caused me. This revelation makes me sick to my stomach realizing the extent of work and diligence I provided only to find out it was based a huge scam I was a victim of the whole time. Even though I'm directly affected by this case and completely entitled to the proceeds, I was not told about this suit at all and had no idea of its existence until the date of this writing, XX/XX/XXXX. And not to be blunt, but I don't want to hear the payments stopped in XX/XX/XXXX, because that would be extremely unfair and detrimental towards me especially since the entire case hadn't been disclosed to me whatsoever and I have irrefutable evidence of how I'm the definition of the affected consumer in this situation. Had I not curiously been browsing the Consumer Financial Protection website ; I still wouldn't have known. I was never even informed considering how directly I was a victim of it. All I wanted to do is pay off my debt as honest hard-working guy. \n",
      "Even more so, I just obtained an XXXX  credit report dating XX/XX/XXXX ( i can provide documentation ) and I've found that FDR had outright lied about accounts being paid off. As you can see on the display that FDR provides to myself through their website, it shows the debt payments completely paid but then when you look at the XXXX report, they're still listed as bad debt and not paid/settled as FDR led me to believe. That is the definition a fraud/deceptive practices. \n",
      "And my question is this, did they down right steal all the money that was supposed to go towards paying off those accounts???

      "Incorrect Predictions:\n",
      "Text: In XXXX of this year, I was approached via phone by a representative from Lexington Law Firm offering financial advice and assistance in resolving consumer debt. I initially agreed to a five-day free trial of their services. However, after conducting an internet search and discovering numerous negative reviews about the firm, I immediately contacted the representative to cancel the subscription within the trial period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my clear instructions to cancel the subscription, I was shocked to find an unauthorized charge of $160.00 drafted from my checking account at [Bank Name] on [Date, Year]. I contacted Lexington Law Firm and, after an arduous conversation with a paralegal (who, I later found out, is not registered in the state of Utah), I was eventually promised a refund by a supervisor. This refund, confirmed via email, was supposed to be processed by XXXX of this year, but to date, it has not been received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further attempts to resolve this issue led me to another supervisor, who admitted the refund had not been processed but promised it would be done by XXXX. This entire experience has been frustrating and has eroded my trust in Lexington Law Firm. The staff I interacted with were often rude and dismissive, insisting I was still a \"member\" despite my clear refusal of their services.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is most concerning about my experience with Lexington Law Firm is:\n",
      "\n",
      "The pending lawsuit against them for violating the Telemarketing Sales Rule, which prohibits upfront fees for credit repair services before any services are rendered.\n",
      "The failure to process a promised refund by the agreed date.\n",
      "The employment of individuals claiming to be paralegals without proper licensing in the state of Utah.\n",
      "Given these circumstances, and the firm's failure to honor its refund promise, I am left with no choice but to pursue legal action, including potential criminal charges, against Lexington Law Firm. I have already filed a complaint with the Utah Consumer Protection Division and plan to dispute the charge with my credit union.\n",
      "\n",
      "I demand immediate action from Lexington Law Firm to rectify this situation, including the processing of the promised refund. Failure to do so will result in further legal action., Predicted: 2, Actual: 3\n",
      "Text: I enrolled in your credit repair service with the expectation of a significant boost in my credit score, particularly for a mortgage and business credit. Despite paying for the service that promised to increase my score by 100 points or more, I'm stuck in the same spot, which is incredibly frustrating. I understand consumer law emphasizes fair and equal credit reporting, and I was counting on your service to deliver that. I urgently need you to update my rapid rescore for my mortgage and business credit, as it's not just about the numbers; it's about maintaining stability for my family and progressing with my business plans. I'm reaching out with the hope that you can expedite this process and help me get back on track as soon as possible. Thank you., Predicted: 3, Actual: 2\n",
      "Text: In XX/XX/2022 I was surprised to find out that I was rejected from being able to accept the student loans that I had qualified for in order to send my daughter to college. This was a shock considering I am a single working mother with one job of over 28 years, and no debt at all except for a mortgage. I only have one credit card that I use, and I have no outstanding debt at all except my mortgage. I pay all my credit card statements in full each month, so there is no debt in my name. I asked for a full credit report from XXXX XXXX to find out why I was rejected. I was shocked to find that the report showed a name on my credit report that was not my name ( they have since taken off ). In addition, the report showed a phone number that I don't recognize. I have some credit cards that were issued in my name from XXXX including a debt collection agency ( Jefferson Capital Systems ) that has tried to get {$4200.00} from an unpaid XXXX XXXX account XXXX even though I have never had the credit cards named, nor have I I never had a XXXX XXXX account XXXX I issued an immediate investigation by XXXX XXXX and in XXXX I was told that the report was accurate. I have tried contacting Jefferson Capital Systems and have been unable to even get into their system. I also contacted my family financial advisor and she was unable to give me any names of people or companies that may help. I hope you can help to investigate further how these accounts were issued in my name and remove them from my credit history! Thank you., Predicted: 1, Actual: 2\n",

      "I joined Self Inc.'s credit-building program, attracted by their promise to help improve credit scores through a prepaid credit build system. I diligently followed their process, opening an account, depositing funds, and even obtaining a Self credit card. Over nearly two years, I maintained a good payment history, fully paying off my credit card with a $XXXX credit limit and nearing the completion of my loan account.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, just as I was about to complete my loan term and had accumulated $XXXX in my credit builder account, Self Inc. abruptly closed both my accounts. This action was taken without any clear explanation, other than a vague statement that my accounts were \"under review.\" It has been four months since this incident, and I have not received any legitimate justification for their actions nor the return of my funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "This closure not only deprived me of the money I had saved but also caused a significant drop in my credit score. The sudden closure of both my credit card and loan account, which were in good standing, has been detrimental to my financial health.\n",

      "I have attempted to resolve this issue directly with Self Inc. but have found it impossible to contact their financial department directly. All my communications have been through email, with no satisfactory resolution.
