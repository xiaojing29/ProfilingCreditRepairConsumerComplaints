      "Incorrect Predictions:\n",
      "Text: Good afternoon, I was contacted by cell phone by a representative from Lexington Law Firm in XXXX of this year regarding financial advice in helping to resolve consumer debt. I agreed verbally at the time to sign up for a five day free trial of their services, but contacted the representative immediately after having performed an internet serach of said law firm, having discovered that they have a terrible on-line reputation, according to their customers. I immediately called the representative and clearly stated that he was to cancel this subscription during the trial period, because I discovered their ill-reputed reputation online. He agreed. On XX/XX/XXXX of this year, I discovered that Lexington Law Firm made a compleletly unauthorized draft in the amount of {$160.00} from my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I made telephone contact with them, and after having spent an hour trying to convince a paralegal ( who is not registrered as such by the state of Utah ) to transfer me to a supervisor, which he did. XXXX XXXX, with LL, sent me an email confirmation of the refund, which I have uploaded to my complaint. The refund was promised as was written, by today, XX/XX/2023. I have not received the refund. I was able to contact several \" supervisors '' at this firm today and reached XXXX XXXX, who admitted that the refund had not been processed but would do so XX/XX/2023, which would take another 3-5 days to process. I feel lied to by XXXX XXXX, and am wary that the putative refund to be processed today will ever appear in my checking account. I was treated very rudely by earlier personnel with whom I spoke, who insisted I was a \" member '' despite my refusing the subscription in time and blew me off during he conversation. I was finally able to contact another supervisor and am attaching her email response as well. Tomorrow, if the funds aren't in my account, I intend to file a dispute with my credit union. I have already filed a complaint with the state of Utah Consumer Protection Division. What concerns me the most about my experience with this outfit is XXXX ) A pending lawsuit accusing them of violating the Telemarketing Sales Rule, which bans upfront fees for credit repairing services before any services have been delivered. XXXX ) A promise to have made a refund of money by today 's date, XX/XX/2023, which has not occurred. XXXX ) People claiming they are paralegals who aren't even licensed by the state of Utah. Because this promised refund did not appear, and I doubt what was promised to me today will ever happen as I have lost all trust with this outfit. I and my credit union plan to take legal action against Lexington Law including possible criminal charges if they are not going to honor the promised refund by the end of the business day today., Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: XXXX whole year Ive been going thur identity theft all XXXX credit bureaus have my documents and police report on file. I pay monthly for Experian app to keep my information safe and secure. I also have locks and freeze on my account including a pin which I change that and my email frequently due to ID theft. Somehow Experian is still allowing this thief to hack my account that I pay monthly to protect and alert me when someone apply or change anything on my account. Which is all fraud this person changes my personal information adding contact numbers Ive never had changing my email address so when they apply for new credit the company would call the fraudulent numbers. Experian is allowing this thief to add fraudulent addresses to my account that is vacant houses.Address that are not on file for me to receive mail from United States post office. I also have a statement up stating the only XXXX addresses and only XXXX should be on file for me. Experian still allows the fraudulent person to update new things to my personal information on my credit report its unbelievable. I also believe someone here that works at this company is also using my information, due to the fact I have a pin set only myself and Experian knows it, so how is this other person/persons still getting in my account? They are very unprofessional now my information has been uploaded to dark web ect this has really ruined my life, Predicted: 0, Actual: 1\n",
      "Text: I'm writing to flag a major issue with a group of companies that roped me into a credit consolidation scam. The culprits? Americor Financial, Credit9 Lending, and a few others. They got me through mail offers, promising to handle my credit debt without pushing me into bankruptcy. Sounded good, but it's been a nightmare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the deal: they claim they'll negotiate my debt, but all they do is let my credit cards hit delinquency, tanking my credit score. Then, when my creditors finally offer me a deal to settle the debt, these guys charge me 25% of my original debt. For what? Sitting back and watching my credit score dive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gets worse. After a year of payments, which I thought were fixing my debt, they dangle this fake loan in front of me. This \"loan\" is supposed to cover the rest of my debt, but guess what? It's a trap. The loan is from their sister company, and applying for it just hits my credit score even harder. And the loan amount? It's way less than what they promised, leaving me with a high-interest loan and a pile of debt that they never even touched.\n",

I was actually quite offended when I first brought this up and they told me they would be kind enough to refund me one of those charges but not the rest. The way I read that is it's our money to do whatever we wish and here 's XXXX bucks for your problems. It doesn't work that way. There are laws against that specifically when I came to make this complaint it was literally an option to click services paid for but not received. They had me paying {$20.00} a month I'm supposedly what they say is my fault because after everything is paid off I'm supposed to then call them back and let them know I don't want them to take the money from me anymore they're not providing me with anything but I need to call them and tell them to stop taking money from me. That's a complete scam they have that there on purpose because they know for a fact that's not how normal loans work nor is it how any service is provided because once the service is done the payments are done not in this case. In this case once your business is done with them they continue to take until you say no more and then when you do they pretend like they're doing you a favor by giving you your last payment back rather than all of your money that you are due that they stole from you. Either way I told them already to stop doing it which also shown in my records which I will provide the {$19.00} that they gave back to me out of the kindness of their heart but that doesn't account for the at least eight from what I'm able to pull up it could be more but as of what I have right now there are eight payments of {$20.00} that they think is their money for providing me no service for trying to take it on a technicality that I never saw that's for sure beforehand otherwise who would in their right mind tell them to stop taking money why would I want you to take money from me if you're not providing me anything but yet that's the way your system works and that can only be for one reason because no one again in their right mind would pay a company just to pay a company. \n",

In XXXX, 3 months to completion of my credit builder loan account ... that's when they randomly closed both my accounts secured credit card and loan account with $ XXXX already saved in the credit builder account apart from my {$2400.00} paid Self secured credit card.

This went on until XXXX of XXXX when I received an email stating that my accounts would be closed. The reason they said was that my information couldnt be verified. This is a lie because all of my information was verified when I opened the account and nothing changed. The email said that they would pay out all the money I was owed within 14 days. Its now been a month and a half and I still havent received the money. Ive called and emailed them several times and have been unable to get any results about what information couldnt be verified or when I will receive my money.

Over nearly two years, I maintained a good payment history, fully paying off my credit card with a $XXXX credit limit and nearing the completion of my loan account.\n",

This action was taken without any clear explanation, other than a vague statement that my accounts were \"under review.\" It has been four months since this incident, and I have not received any legitimate justification for their actions nor the return of my funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "This closure not only deprived me of the money I had saved but also caused a significant drop in my credit score. The sudden closure of both my credit card and loan account, which were in good standing, has been detrimental to my financial health.\n",

My research and discussions with others who have used their services suggest that this practice of closing accounts without proper cause is a recurring issue, especially when customers are close to completing their payment terms.\n",

They tried to make every excuse why not to cancel but yet I never got a 60 day or 90 day update they just sent me a text who the new person was that month. A man named XXXX XXXX called me and told me he was working with 90 day credit experts and they agreed to cancel my contract if I paid a fee in which I did. I also received an email from him telling me my contract was cancelled and the account removed from my credit report. That was XX/XX/XXXX. Today I received a text from a collection agency telling me 90 day credit experts gave my account to them. I called and told them I was told my contract was cancelled after paying the fee and sent them the email. Then reached out to XXXX XXXX and he told me the same my contract was cancelled. The manager at XXXX named XXXX called me back and told me that my contract was never cancelled with 90 day credit experts that it was only cancelled with denefits who apparently are the people that take the payments. I called XXXX back again and he told me that is not the case but then his tune got a little different not really telling me what I paid to cancel.

I immediately called the and told them that wanted to cancel my agreement. I asked them for an email confirming the cancellation. I received that email on XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX would not negotiate what is my biggest collection at around XXXX. They took me to court which they said could happen but I would be represented by a qualified attorney. That turned out to be quite the joke. They gave me an attorney from out of state who was one of the most arrogant people I have ever spoken to. I gave him all of my financial information. Side note, my wife of over XXXX years passed suddenly in XX/XX/XXXX, I was out of work on XXXX due to grieving and this man was I think, the most ignorant person Ive ever spoken to. First court date doesnt show so I tried to find out as much about him as possible. I learned he did not have very positive reviews or even a decent amount of positive negotiations. So at that point I took that off the program. They also failed to negotiate with XXXX other creditors. So they negotiated XXXX out of XXXX and the total of those XXXX alone is more than XXXX. They are still taking the monthly for reasons I dont understand. The ones they settled should be long paid if it was only XXXX in debt negotiations.
